> My angel, my all, my very self. ...just a few words today, and that with pencil--(with yours) not until tomorrow will my lodgings be determined with certainty, what a useless waste of time in such things--why this deep sorrow where necessity speaks.--Can our love exist other than through sacrifices, through not demanding everything.  Can you change it that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine--O God look into beautiful nature and calm your mind about that which must be--love demands everything and rightfully so, so it is for me with you, for you with me--only you forget so easily that I have to live for me and for you, were we wholly united, you would feel the pain (of it) as little as I--my journey here was terrible I only arrived here yesterday at 4 in the morning, since there was a lack of horses, the post chose another road, but what a terrible road, at the station before the last I was warned not to travel by night, they made me afraid of a forest, but that only challenged me--and I was wrong, the carriage had to break down on this terrible road  without reason, just a country road, without such coach riders as I had, I would have been stranded on the road--Esterhazi had the same fate on the usual route with eight horses, as I with four--however, I also found some joy in it, as always when I happily overcome something.--now quickly to inner things from the outer, we will very likely see each other soon, also today I cannot convey to you my observations that I have made about my life during these few days--were our hearts always closely together, I would make none of that kind.  my heart is full to tell you many things--oh--There are moments, when I find that language is still nothing at all--cheer up, remain my true only treasure, my all, as I (am) yours  the Gods must send (us) the rest, what for us must be and shall be.--

> Your faithful ludwig.--
