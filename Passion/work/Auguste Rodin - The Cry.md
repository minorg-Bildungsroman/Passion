> Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the Angelic

> the beginning of terror, that we are still able to bear,  
> and we revere it so, because it calmly disdains  
> to destroy us.

Rainer Maria Rilke, _Duino Elegies_, translated by [A.S. Kline](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/Admin/Copyright.php)
